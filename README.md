# Data Mining
This repository contains some selected homework assignments from WVU's
STAT745 - Data Mining course.

Most assignments were broken up into two parts, a theoretical group
assignment and an individual coding assignment.

Note that for the coding assignments, we were given skeleton code and
asked to fill it in, so the structure doesn't necessarily reflect how
I would do it from scratch.
